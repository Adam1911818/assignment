# DevOps Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the DevOps assignment. The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate basic ability to work with Docker features by containerizing a simple Node.js/Express REST API.

## Files Included

1. **main.js**: Simple Node.js/Express REST API that returns a "Hello, World!" response on port 3000.
2. **package.json**: Dependency management file.

## Instructions

Follow the steps below to complete the assignment:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in your terminal or command prompt to install the required dependencies. This will generate `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` files.

3. **Run the API Locally**: Execute `node main.js` to run the API locally. Access the API at http://localhost:3000 to see the response "Hello, World!".

4. **Dockerize the Application**:
    - Create a `Dockerfile` to build an image of the code.
    - Build the Docker image using `docker build -t my-node-app .`.
    - Run a container using the created image with `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app`.

5. **Bonus Task - Docker Compose**:
    - Write a `docker-compose.yml` file and use `docker-compose up -d` to start the container.
